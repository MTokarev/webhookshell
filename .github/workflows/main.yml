# TODO: Currently all jobs will create a different releases with the same name
# For Example:
# 1. Release 5 (for linux x64)
# 2. Release 5 (for windows x64)
# This needs to be fixed. Only one release should be created at the pipeline run, and that release should include all artifacts (windows, linux, etc)
